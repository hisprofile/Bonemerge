Bonemerge for Blender behaves similarly to the addon for Garry's Mod, Bonemerge. Its main purpose is to combine bones between a cosmetic and an armature.
In other words, it makes it so a character is wearing a clothing item.

This addon is specific to my 3rd generation of mercenaries, and the cosmetic side of the TF2 collection.
